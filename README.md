**Problem Statement**
The concept of identifying genres of books and implementing a hybrid recommendation engine to enhance user experience encompasses several interrelated components, each contributing to a more personalized and effective book discovery process. Let's expand on the key elements of this concept:
- 1. Genre Identification
  2. Hybrid Recommendation Engine
     - Collaborative Filtering
     - Content-Based Filtering
     - Contextual Recommendations

**Objective**
Developing a hybrid book recommendation system that combines collaborative filtering and content-based methods involves integrating multiple data sources and recommendation strategies to provide users with accurate and diverse book suggestions. This system aims to leverage the strengths of both collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques while considering user preferences, historical interactions, and book genres
